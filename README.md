# Honey-Production
🐝 Honey Production Prediction
This project aims to analyze historical honey production data and predict future honey production using Linear Regression. The model forecasts honey production trends up to the year 2050 based on past data.

📌 Features
Data Preprocessing: Reads honey production data and aggregates total production per year.
Data Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to plot historical trends and future predictions.
Predictive Model: Implements Linear Regression from sklearn to predict future honey production.
Forecasting: Extends predictions up to the year 2050 and estimates production levels.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib (for visualization)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Scikit-Learn (for implementing Linear Regression)
📊 Output
The model provides a visualized trend of honey production and predicts the production value for the year 2050.
